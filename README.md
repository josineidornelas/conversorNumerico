# Numeric Converter
## Created by Josinei Dornelas

The numerical converter is a personal project and has a didactic purpose. With this project I am putting into practice several concepts seen in my college and in autonomous studies.

Technologies employed: 

- HTML5;
- CSS3;
- Javascript.

## Project Considerations

I'm a beginner and I want to become a developer prepared for market challenges. Ebora with little time to study, having a formal job and a six-year-old son, I dedicate every spare moment to this desire to learn.

I do the best I can, within my technical limitations, so I'm open to suggestions and new learning. If necessary, I can rebuild the entire project so that it conforms to market requirements and is built on best development practices.

If you've read this far, thank you so much for your time!

Graciously
